# GithubStory
The final submission project for DiCoding's "Android Intermediate" course is to create a Story application.

In this project I implemented:
- Implement MVVM Architecture on each page and display data using LiveData.
- Implementing Paging on RecycleView using Paging 3
- Implementing Single Source of Truth (SSOT) by utilizing Room
- Authentication Page feature by implementing Custom View on EditText.
- List of Stories that displays a list of stories from the API provided and the Story Details page.
- Add Story to upload stories in the form of text, images, and locations to the API server.
- Using Property Animation on the Story Detail page
- Display the Story List on the Map in the form of markers and display information in the Marker Window.
- Apply Unit Testing to the function in the ViewModel that retrieves the Paging data list.
